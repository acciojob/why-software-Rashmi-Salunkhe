    <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p> I enjoyed solving problems and building things, which naturally led me to software development. Software developer is the ability to do so. As you'd be taught every nook and cranny of development, you'll have a better understanding of how the computer world works and be able to pitch your ideas for creating software that will help others.</p>
